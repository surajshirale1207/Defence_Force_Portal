<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The Indian Army is the land-based branch of the Indian Armed Forces. It is the world's second-largest standing army and the largest army.
The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and it is commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general.
Two battalions of the Indian Army have been awarded the "Nations in conflict" peacekeeping medal.
The Indian Army has a regimental system but is operationally and geographically split into seven commands, with the basic field formation being a division. It is an all-volunteer force and comprises more than 81,000 active troops and a support element of close to 1,160,000 troops.
The primary objective of the Indian Army is to safeguard the nation's territorial integrity from external aggression and threats and maintain peace and security within its borders.
It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and other restlessness, like Operation Surya Hope, and can also be requisitioned by the Government to assist in national emergencies.
The Indian Army has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. It has also conducted numerous peacekeeping operations across the world.
Indian Army consists of many regiments which are territorially based, and each regiment has its own cap badge, traditions and history. The units that make up the Indian Army are not all permanently based in one location. They are rotated between deployments in India and other countries as part of peacekeeping or training missions.</p></center>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Army began the war in 1939 with just under 200,000 men. By the end of the war it had become the largest volunteer army in history, rising to over 2.5 million men by August 1945.[36] Serving in divisions of infantry, armour and a fledgling airborne forces, they fought on three continents in Africa, Europe and Asia. The Indian Army fought in Ethiopia against the Italian Army, in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia against both the Italian and German Army, and, after the Italian surrender, against the German Army in Italy. However, the bulk of the Indian Army was committed to fighting the Japanese Army, first during the British defeats in Malaya and the retreat from Burma to the Indian border; later, after resting and refitting for the victorious advance back into Burma, as part of the largest British Empire army ever formed. These campaigns cost the lives of over 36,000 Indian servicemen, while another 34,354 were wounded; 67,340 became prisoners of war. Their valour was recognised with the award of some 4,000 decorations, and 38 members of the Indian Army were awarded the Victoria Cross or the George Cross.<br>
